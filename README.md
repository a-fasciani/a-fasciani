## Hi,

I'm a lawyer based in Geneva, currently exploring how **technology and law** can work together.  
I’ve started learning **Python**, with the goal of developing small, well-structured projects that make everyday life easier or help me explore new ideas.

### 🔭 Current Focus  
- Learning the fundamentals of **Python programming**
- Experimenting with small tools to **automate repetitive tasks**  
- Exploring how automation, data, and AI tools can enhance **legal practice and access to information**  
- Building small, practical projects that solve real problems

### ⚖️ Background  
My professional background is in **law**, where clarity and structure matter as much as creativity.  
Coding feels like a natural extension of that mindset — it’s another language for solving problems and expressing ideas with precision.
